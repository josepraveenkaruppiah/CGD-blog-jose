# Rocket Rebels - Second Entry

The Second entry, I have made a lobby system and can connect to the server and join a lobby with selection pannel.

My teammates Ashiq and Jeswin did not make any progress and the others have made progress as well.

I have made progress on the server side programming and made basic lobby system.
