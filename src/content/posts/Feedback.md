## What Went Well
- **Consistent Progress & Documentation**
    Throughout this project, I kept a clear and structured development log that helped me track my progress step by step—from learning the basics of Photon Unity Networking (PUN) to integrating everything into the final game.

- **Independent Learning**
    I took the initiative to learn PUN independently through official documentation and YouTube tutorials. This helped me get comfortable with both basic and more advanced multiplayer networking concepts.

- **Implemented a Functional Lobby System**
    I built a complete multiplayer lobby system that evolved steadily each week. I started with basic network connections and moved towards a feature-rich lobby where players could choose their teams and abilities.

- **Final Integration**
    Integrating everything into the main game was one of the most challenging tasks, especially converting previously offline mechanics into fully networked components. I’m proud of how I managed to overcome those issues and make it all work together.

- **Bug Fixing & Debugging**
    I significantly improved my debugging skills during this project. I developed a much better understanding of how networked behaviours interact with core gameplay logic, and I got more comfortable solving problems on the go.

## What I Learned
- I’ve gained hands-on experience with core PUN functionalities.

- I learned how to manage multiplayer logic like lobbies, team selection, and ability syncing.

- I figured out how to tie in UI and game logic into a multiplayer setting.

- I became better at problem-solving and tackling bugs, especially in a networked environment.

## Team Experience

- Two of my teammates (Ashiq and Jeswin) didn’t contribute much to the development process. I noted this throughout the journal logs while maintaining professionalism.

- Despite the uneven team effort, I kept moving forward and made sure the project didn’t fall behind.

- I collaborated well with the rest of the team and maintained a positive attitude to keep things on track.

## Areas I Can Improve

- **Written Polish**
    Some of my journal entries had typos and clumsy phrasing. I realise now that more polished writing would improve the professionalism of my documentation—especially if I want to include this in my portfolio.

- **Terminology Accuracy**
    A few terms and phrases like "selection pannel" or "cast my a locally selected ability" were either misspelled or not clearly stated. I need to focus on being more precise with technical language.

- **Video Presentation**
    I could improve how I present videos for documentation—ensuring titles are clear and that I demonstrate exactly what was accomplished in each phase.


## Final Thoughts

Looking back, I feel proud of what I accomplished in Rocket Rebels. Even with limited support from some teammates, I managed to independently tackle one of the most complex parts of the project: building the multiplayer system using PUN. I stayed consistent, picked up new skills along the way, and pushed through technical challenges. With a bit more polish in how I present my work—especially in writing and videos—I believe this project will be a strong addition to both my academic and professional portfolio.
