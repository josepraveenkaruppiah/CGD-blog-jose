# Rocket Rebels - Final Entry

The Final entry, I have integrated everything together the game part and the server part of the gaem, and it was hard to work on the integration part but i have did my best, the game has 4 players limit, and in the video i can only do 2, also it has 4 abilities for players to choose from, the game has a condition to win if a team scores 3 points, the winner is decided and the game restarts.

My teammates Ashiq and Jeswin did not work/appear in this assignment no progress made, and the others have made progress.

I have made a jump in progress in the integration part as the game mechanics were all made without networking aspects, had to fix them all and made it all work.

### Video - Final Entry
Integrated and put everything together and its a working game

## Learning Outcome
I have learned a lot in this entry as i have done the integration part, and learned a lot on game side server work and by fixing a lot of bugs, debugging became a bit more easier.

### Further Plan
Submit the game.
