# Rocket Rebels - Third Entry

The Third entry, I have made a working lobby that lets player choose their ability and join the game, a join lobby button that lets you join a open lobby.

My teammates Ashiq and Jeswin did not make any progress this week as entry as well, and the others have made progress.

I have made progress on the server side programming and made better lobby system than last time this we have a basic lobby system that lets you choose a team, and the game that lets people choose their abilities.

## Learning Outcome
I have learned how to cast my a locally selected ability and team to other players who join the lobby, and set rules so that the players cant start the game alone.

### Further Plan
Integrate everything together and submit it.
